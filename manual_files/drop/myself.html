											Thank you for visiting my website. This "About Myself" section could be summarized as <b>"What I do and think about"</b>. It is an exploration of my identity as engineer and artist. You can find a variety of my hobbies and inspirational sources down below. </br> </br>I will try describe my thoughts and activism regarding important matters such as climate change, design, and politically conscious engineering with the aid of small essays. All sections below describe parts that define me as an individual and professional. Please note that I'm deliberatily making a point of not differentiating between my personal and professional identity.</br></br>

								<h4>The Importance of Listening (in Design and Engineering)</h4>
									<p>
										I believe that it is crucial to know that knowing (knowledge) is not enough. I am stating this as a general wisdom and specific advice to myself as a designer and engineer. We can’t possibly know what an experience is like that we have knowledge about but never experienced. This applies to engineering in the design sense that we have to personally experience what we are designing for. But also in the politics sense that we overestimate the human alterness and ability to act and try to change if we haven’t actually experienced other forms of being. <i>No constructive change can be made if we lack the understanding of the matter, which inevitably happens if we haven't experienced the matter but only know about it.</i></p>

										<p>I like to think of human capability to act responsibly as a privilige related to <i>experience bubbles</i>. I define experience bubbles as any sort of experience that is stuck in someone's memory as a brick to build new thoughts on. I don’t introduce this concept to sell it to you but to emphasize that the current way of thinking about humans ability to act is falsely based on science. As science creates the misperception that knowing but not having experienced can possible be enough. This is where true design thinking becomes hard in the technical, scientific engineering world. I believe that a good designer truly understands that they can't possibly imagine an experience without having exerienced it. </p>

										<p>If we apply this thought in a design context, we run into the issue that design for others is inherently defined as a top-down relationship. Furthermore, as a good desinger, we try to neglect our own expererience bubbles. This leaves us with an odd dichotomy that we can't possibly know without having experienced, but we can't base our design on our own experience bubbles. Having understood this conflict, the art of listening emerges as an essential part of design. However, the art of listening goes far beyond its role in design. </p>

										<p>So what do I mean by listening? Genuine listening is the art of trying to understand your opponent as truly as possible, understanding someone else in the way they understand themselves and the world around them. As long as this requirement is not given, we have a hard time helping others in any given context. Engineers have an even harder time with this matter because they are used to listening to "facts" and interpreting them while listening. However, the interpretation needs to be postponed  when true listening is practiced to get to the core of the communication.</p>

								<h3>Activism</h3>
								<h3>Essays on Climate Change</h3>
								<h4>Uniformity and Globalization in the Context of Climate Change</h4>
								<p>I consider climate change to be the trigger for many societal issues that are to come. Climate change and globalization are two major globally-scaled events that are currently happening, and the ugly face of globalization will soon rise on the horizon. Globalization is the process of matching and aligning different standards of living. Sociologically speaking, globalization is currently creating a new form of a unified culture as the world has been culturally too complex to be mixed up. In an economic sense, the process of unification can be seen when developing countries try to abide by the standards of modern capitalism. Capitalism has proven to be a powerful engine for now well-developed societies. As prosperity in such countries has increased drastically, other countries try to catch-up.</p>

								<p>Since globalization is closely tied to modern free-market structures, and the technology that led to many Western achievements has become cheaper, developing countries are trying to catch up. I think that the discourse regarding climate change in the US is very much focused on industrial countries. I will have to mention that I am a male, white, engineering student whose experiences have always been far away from the developing world. However, I am scared about the social and economic collapse in the developing world that is to come. For instance, vast parts of China’s and India’s societal infrastructure are currently based on oil, and India is increasingly building oil-based infrastructure. </p>

								<p>So far, climate change has not been recognized as a worldwide crisis. This is safe to say as it draws less attention than the epidemics such as the Novel Coronavirus. However, there will be a time when climate change will become the #1 contemporary catastrophe. With this long explanation in mind, I want to bring up my main point: <br><br><i>Climate change will be a problem of the developing world and it is hypocritical to even assume that the industrialized world will suffer to a similar extent. Climate change will show the ugly imperialistic structure that started the machine of globalization.</i> </p>

								<h2>The Western World</h2>
								<p>
									I think a major misperception is that the western world has the strength to better the world because the Western world hold an incredible amount of resources. However, as long as we don’t perceive the world that we want to make better, we deceive the point. <i>No constructive change can be made if we lack the understanding of the matter, which inevitably happens if we haven't experienced the matter but only know about it.</i> And no help is done.
