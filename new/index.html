            <p>🌀 At <a target="_blank" href="https://www.natelenergy.com/turbines/">Natel Energy</a>, I worked as a mechanical engineer and environmental researcher to build fish-safe water turbines to reduce the deadly impact of hydropower on ecosystems. I conducted and published a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10385" target="_blank">peer-reviewed study</a> to test the turbine's impact on passing eels.<br>
            🌀 I designed and built a <a href="off-the-grid-renewable.html">sun-tracker</a> (pan-tilt mechanism) for five solar panels with Odalys Benitez at an off-the-grid farm.<br>
            🌀 As part of my Master's in Engineering, Sustainability, and Health, the concepts of <a href="https://www.omprakash.org/blog/just-energy-hub-exploration" target="_blank">energy sovereignty</a> for historically excluded communities and ethical supply chain design stood in the focus of my partnership with students from Olin College and CalPoly.<br>
            🌀 I conducted a siting study and prototyped a <a href="off-the-grid-renewable.html">vertical-axis wind turbine</a> with Jasmine Kamdar.<br></p>

                      First, I share building blocks of the historical context that have led to a world-wide state of destruction and oppression. Then, I share a variety of spiritual frameworks to address the root cause of violence & destruction. Both of these sections (B & C) are a quite accurate summary of my brain.<br> <br>

                          through connecting with & observing the world inside us & around us we may become aware of the interconnected, impermanent nature of reality • the realization that we all die & are part of the same inexplicable something may bring about compassion with others by feeling connected through love & suffering (Tolle 1999) • through this deep insight into the nature of reality, our understanding of who we are changes and allows us to operate from a new place (Tubali 2019)<br><br>

                          I see an opportunity to liberate ourselves from destructive & oppressive social structures (social institutions and our personal selves) by integrating other forms of story telling, our emotions, our bodily experiences, our intuition, and connection to our inner source (Monica Dennis) into spaces that seek transformative change for everyone’s thriving (ecological justice) • the internal process is of importance because our body-mind-spirit complexes are the instruments through which communication & action emerge<br><br>

                          our internal world reflects structures of external social systems (Scharmer 2015) • therefore, our inner world is a great place to start the process of self-transformation and self-improvement • the personal process will inevitably affect our social systems because our internal values and beliefs condition the social structures we create • since our social systems recreate themselves and the conditions for their emergence (Luhmann 1998), a high level of consciousness (personal & collective) of embedded values & beliefs in the system structures is essential in creating social systems conducive to a thriving world for all

Inspired by the Ohlone vision to revive this space, I imagine how different the East Bay architecture & landscape would look if it had not been colonized and its population lived aligned with ecological health.<br><br>

            What would the east bay look like if it had not been colonized?<br><br>

            The Ohlone people share a whole set of aspirations for the relationship between land & people. I hope to take you on a little walk of imagining how indigenous communities would have shaped the land - as architects and engineers who consciously influence their environment. </p>

            <span class="more"><p>This work is my <b>first</b> intellectual collection of building blocks for my engineering practice inspired by "complex systems thinking" - a scientific lens that seeks to bridge disciplinary boundaries, embracing and observing the wholeness (holistic) nature of living systems. I further explore new scientific methedologies such as participatory research as part of a holistic (non-reductionist)approach to responding to our challenges. I critically examine the scientific method and develop a an approach to creating solutions to climate change: we may become nature's apprenctice, change our research methedology to empowering  affected communities (instead of studying them & reducing them to numbers), and approach our interconnected world through the all-embracing science of complex systems thinking.</p>

              <p>
                We see a misalignment between the engineering field’s constitutive-interests rooted
                in the reductionist sciences and the needs of the 21st century in the socio-political,
                environmental, and spiritual realms. Following Habermas’s critical theory, the
                knowledge-constitutive interest of the natural and reductionist sciences lie primarily in
                the manipulation of the physical world for the purpose of predictable and quantifiable
                outcomes by reducing the studied system to its smallest components. Such interests are
                unfit to understand and intervene in our world; a living world of dynamic complexity. We
                argue that a renewed science of holism will create the conditions for a critical engineering
                education that can mimic the properties of living systems to recreate a thriving existence
                for all living beings on this planet. In this thesis, we identify six loose web-nodes to
                draw a picture of a science for the whole: (1) Natural phenomena such as emergence,
                self-organization, or autopoiesis acquaint us with the nature of nature. (2) The study
                of our world brings us closer to our cosmos’s mysteries, which naturally introduces
                spirituality to the holistic web. (3) Dynamically complex systems theory attempts to
                understand the relationships between parts of the system to make assumptions about
                future behavior or opportunities for intervention. Practices that are commensurate with
                the nature of reality are crucial for an effective engagement with living systems. Such
                practices include (4) methods for a co-creation of the future and (5) research and learning
                methodologies that embrace unpredictable emergence of insights and emancipate us
                from hidden oppressive power structures. (6) Lastly, a holistic science includes the
                reductionist sciences to analyze, predict, and control non-living, simple systems. Our
                hope is that a holistic science will re-shape engineers’ understanding to learn and interact
                with our world to recreate the nature of nature in our systems: a thriving existence for all.
